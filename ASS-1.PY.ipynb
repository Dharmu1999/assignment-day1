    "\n",
    "The garbage collector in Python is responsible for reclaiming memory that is no longer being used by the program. When an object is created in Python, it is allocated a certain amount of memory. When the object is no longer needed, the memory it occupies is returned to the system and made available for future use.\n",

    "To optimize memory usage, Python uses a number of techniques such as object sharing, caching, and recycling.
